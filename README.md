This repository contains coursework and practice projects for **IT115 – Software Development & Version Control** at North Seattle College.  
The course focuses on software development fundamentals, version control systems, and collaborative workflows using industry-standard tools.

## Purpose of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The purpose of the SDLC is to provide a structured approach to planning, building, testing, deploying, and maintaining software systems. It helps ensure software is developed efficiently, meets user requirements, reduces risks, and maintains quality throughout its lifecycle.

## Purpose of Version Control Systems
Version control systems are used to track changes in source code, manage different versions of a project, and support collaboration among developers. They help prevent data loss, allow rollback to previous versions, and enable multiple developers to work on the same codebase effectively.
